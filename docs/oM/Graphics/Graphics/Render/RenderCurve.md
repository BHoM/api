## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Curve | [ICurve](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Curve/ICurve) | The curve to render. | - |
| Thickness | [int](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Int32?view=netstandard-2.0) | The thickness of the curve. Should be a value greater or equal to 1. | - |

## Properties

### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| IAverageProfileArea | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Gets the average cross-section area of a IFramingElementProperty in such a way that multiplying with the length of the element would give the volume | [Area](/api_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Area) [mÂ²] | Physical_Engine |
| IsNull | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if a IFramingElementProperty is null and outputs relevant error message. | - | Physical_Engine |

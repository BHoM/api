| HookDiameter | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Gets the hook diameter based on the diameter of the reinforcement bar, the shape code and the bend radius. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] | Physical_Engine |
| IsCompliant | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Verifies the dimensions to the standard as determined by the ShapeCode namespace. | - | Physical_Engine |
| IsNull | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if a Reinforcement is null and outputs relevant error message. | - | Physical_Engine |
| IsValid | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Verifies whether the reinforcement is valid by performing null checks. | - | Physical_Engine |
| Length | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Gets the total length of the Reinforcement with ShapeCode00 using the formulation in BS 8666:2020 Table 5. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] | Physical_Engine |
| LinksEndProjection | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Gets the minimum end projection for links where the bend is less than 150 degrees.This is based on the diameter of the reinforcement bar and the standard is determined from the ShapeCode namespace. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] | Physical_Engine |
| MaximumRadius | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Gets the maximum radius based on the diameter of the reinforcement bar.

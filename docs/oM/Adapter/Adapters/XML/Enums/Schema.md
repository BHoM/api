## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public enum Schema : System.Enum, System.ValueType, System.IComparable, System.ISpanFormattable, System.IFormattable, System.IConvertible
```

Assembly: XML_oM.dll

The C# enum definition is available on github:

- [Schema.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/XML_Toolkit/blob/develop/XML_oM/Enums\Schema.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by reference. To do this, use the schema reference below in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/XML_oM/Enums/Schema.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [Schema.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/XML_oM/Enums/Schema.json)

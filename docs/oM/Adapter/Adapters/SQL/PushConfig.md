| WrapNonBHoMObjects | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | If true, the Push action wraps any non-BHoM type into a BH.oM.Adapter.ObjectWrapper, allowing them to make use of the full Adapter workflow. | - |
| AllowHashForComparing | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | If true and if no specific EqualityComparer is found for the type, Diffing hashes are computed and used to compare the objects. | - |
| DiffingConfig | [DiffingConfig](/documentation/oM/Framework/Diffing/DiffingConfig) | Configurations for the Diffing hashing. Requires `AllowHashForComparing` to be set to true. | - |

## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| ElementIds | [List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.List-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[int](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Int32?view=netstandard-2.0)&gt; | List of integers representing Revit ElementIds to be used to filter the elements. | - |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |

If the result is different than defaultDiscipline and neither of two is Undefined, null is returned (the result discipline is conflicting with defaultDiscipline). | - | Revit_Engine |
| IFilterDescription | [string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.String?view=netstandard-2.0) | Returns a description of the filter represented by the given IRequest. | - | Revit_Engine |


## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public class FilterByElementIds : BH.oM.Data.Requests.IRequest, BH.oM.Base.IObject
```

Assembly: Revit_oM.dll

The class is defined in C#. The class definition is available on github:

- [FilterByElementIds.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/Revit_Toolkit/blob/develop/Revit_oM/Requests\FilterByElementIds.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. To reference the schema in a validator like [this](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) to validate a Json instance, please use the lines below:

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Revit_oM/Requests/FilterByElementIds.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [FilterByElementIds.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Revit_oM/Requests/FilterByElementIds.json)

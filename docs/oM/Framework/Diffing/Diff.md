### Implemented interfaces and base types

???+ bhom "The Diff is inheriting from the following base type(s) and implements the following interfaces:"

    -  BH.oM.Base.[IObject](/api/oM/Framework/Base/Interface/IObject)
    -  BH.oM.Base.[IImmutable](/api/oM/Framework/Base/Interface/IImmutable)


## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|

| RemovedObjects | [IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Object?view=netstandard-2.0)&gt; | Objects not present in the second set that were present in the first set. | - |

| UnchangedObjects | [IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Object?view=netstandard-2.0)&gt; | Objects that are recognised as the same in the first and second set. | - |

| DiffingConfig | [DiffingConfig](/api/oM/Framework/Diffing/DiffingConfig) | Default diffing settings for this Stream. Hashes of objects contained in this stream will be computed based on these configs. | - |


## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public class Diff : BH.oM.Base.IObject, BH.oM.Base.IImmutable
```

Assembly: Diffing_oM.dll

The C# class definition is available on github:

- [Diff.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Diffing_oM/Diff.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by refernce. To do this, use the schema reference below in in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Diffing_oM/Diff.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [Diff.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Diffing_oM/Diff.json)

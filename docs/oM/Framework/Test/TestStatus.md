# <small>BH.oM.Test.</small>**TestStatus**

Defines the status of the Test Information. Designed to be very clear, concrete statuses, with minimal ambiguity.

## Enum values

| Name            | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Error |  The status is such that immediate action should be taken, and workflows should not continue further until this is addressed.  |
| Pass |  Everything is good, as close to perfect as we can get, with no further action needing to be taken.  |
| Warning |  Something hasn't quite gone to plan, but is not sufficient enough to stop everything. It is advised to investigate further before continuing, but you can continue before addressing this.  |

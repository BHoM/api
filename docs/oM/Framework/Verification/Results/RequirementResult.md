## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public class RequirementResult : BH.oM.Base.IImmutable, BH.oM.Base.IObject
```

Assembly: Verification_oM.dll

The C# class definition is available on github:

- [RequirementResult.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Results\RequirementResult.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Verification_oM/Results/RequirementResult.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [RequirementResult.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Results/RequirementResult.json)

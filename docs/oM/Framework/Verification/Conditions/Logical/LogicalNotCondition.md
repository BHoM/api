## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public class LogicalNotCondition : BH.oM.Verification.Conditions.ISingleLogicalCondition,
BH.oM.Verification.Conditions.ILogicalCondition,
BH.oM.Verification.Conditions.ICondition,
BH.oM.Base.IObject
```

Assembly: Verification_oM.dll

The C# class definition is available on github:

- [LogicalNotCondition.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions\Logical\LogicalNotCondition.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by reference. To do this, use the schema reference below in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/LogicalNotCondition.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [LogicalNotCondition.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/LogicalNotCondition.json)

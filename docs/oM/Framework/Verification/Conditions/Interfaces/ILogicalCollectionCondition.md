## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the interface

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Conditions | [List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.List-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[ICondition](/api/oM/Framework/Verification/Conditions/Interfaces/ICondition)&gt; | A collection of conditions to be evaluated in combination. | - |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |

## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public interface ILogicalCollectionCondition : BH.oM.Verification.Conditions.ILogicalCondition, BH.oM.Verification.Conditions.ICondition, BH.oM.Base.IObject
```

Assembly: Verification_oM.dll

The C# interface definition is available on github:

- [ILogicalCollectionCondition.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions\Interfaces\ILogicalCollectionCondition.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by reference. To do this, use the schema reference below in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/ILogicalCollectionCondition.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [ILogicalCollectionCondition.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/ILogicalCollectionCondition.json)

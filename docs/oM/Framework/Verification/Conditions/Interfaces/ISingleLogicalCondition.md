## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the interface

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Condition | [ICondition](/api/oM/Framework/Verification/Conditions/Interfaces/ICondition) | Nested condition to be wrapped in the ISingleLogicalCondition. | - |

## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public interface ISingleLogicalCondition : BH.oM.Verification.Conditions.ILogicalCondition, BH.oM.Verification.Conditions.ICondition, BH.oM.Base.IObject
```

Assembly: Verification_oM.dll

The C# interface definition is available on github:

- [ISingleLogicalCondition.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions\Interfaces\ISingleLogicalCondition.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by reference. To do this, use the schema reference below in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/ISingleLogicalCondition.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [ISingleLogicalCondition.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/ISingleLogicalCondition.json)

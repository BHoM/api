title: BoundingBox
---

# Geometry.BoundingBox

An axis aligned cuboid, which describes the smallest volume Box, oriented with the global coordinate system, that fully encompases a set of geometry.
Defined by its two extreme corner Points, these six coordinate values of Min and Max X, Y and Z are combined to specify all eight Box corners.

## Properties

### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| GeometryHash | [string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.String?view=netstandard-2.0) | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for diffing.<br>The hash is computed as a serialised array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimise collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IArea | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the area of the provided geometry. | [Area](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Area) [m²] | Geometry_Engine |
| IBounds | [BoundingBox](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Misc/BoundingBox) | Returns the global world axis oriented enclosing BoundingBox for all points of the geometry, i.e. the box with the smallest volume within which all the points on the geometry lie. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IHashArray | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0)[] | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for distance-based comparisons and diffing.<br>The hash is computed as an array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimise collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IIsPlanar | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if the IGeometry is planar, i.e. all of its parts fit in a single plane. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IIsValid | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if any IGeometry is valid using dynamic dispatch. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| INormals | [List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.List-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[Vector](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector/Vector)&gt; | Interface method that returns the list of vectors normal to any IGeometry. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IsNull | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if a Geometry is null and outputs relevant error message. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| ISubParts | [IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[IGeometry](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Interface/IGeometry)&gt; | Gets the individual parts that make up any IGeometry. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IsValid | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if any IGeometry is valid. Currently returns true for all geometries. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IVolume | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Gets the enclosed volume of a solid. | [Volume](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Volume) [m³] | Geometry_Engine |


## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public interface ISolid : BH.oM.Geometry.IGeometry, BH.oM.Base.IObject
```

Assembly: Geometry_oM.dll

The C# interface definition is available on github:

- [ISolid.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Geometry_oM/Solid\ISolid.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by reference. To do this, use the schema reference below in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Geometry_oM/ISolid.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [ISolid.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Geometry_oM/ISolid.json)

## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Centre | [Point](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Point) | Point defining the centre of the circular base. | - |
| Axis | [Vector](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector) | Vector perperdicular to the base. Defines the orientation in three-dimensional space. | - |
| Radius | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Distance from the Axis to the Cylinder boundary surface. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] |
| Height | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Distance between the base and top surface, measured along the Axis. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

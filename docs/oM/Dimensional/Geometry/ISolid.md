## Properties

### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| GeometryHash | [string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.String?view=netstandard-2.0) | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for diffing.<br>The hash is computed as a serialised array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimize collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IArea | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the area of the provided geometry. | [Area](/api_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Area) [m²] | Geometry_Engine |
| IBounds | [BoundingBox](/api_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/BoundingBox) | Returns the global world axis oriented enclosing BoundingBox for all points of the geometry, i.e. the box with the smallest volume within which all the points on the geometry lie. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IHashArray | [Double[]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double[]?view=netstandard-2.0) | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for distance-based comparisons and diffing.<br>The hash is computed as an array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimize collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IIsPlanar | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if the IGeometry is planar, i.e. all of its parts fit in a single plane. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IIsValid | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | - | - | Geometry_Engine |
| INormals | [List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.List-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[Vector](/api_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector)&gt; | Interface method that returns the list of vectors normal to any IGeometry. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IsNull | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if a Geometry is null and outputs relevant error message. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| ISubParts | [IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[IGeometry](/api_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/IGeometry)&gt; | - | - | Geometry_Engine |

# <small>BH.oM.</small>**CompositeGeometry**

A collection of multiple sets of Geometry of any or mixed type. Integrity, continuity and closure is not guaranteed. Discontinuous and/or mixed type definitions are possible, with no restrictions placed on how geometry can be combined.

## Class structure

### Implemented interfaces and base types

???+ bhom "The CompositeGeometry is inheriting from the following base type(s) and implements the following interfaces:"

    -  BH.oM.Geometry.[IGeometry](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Interface/IGeometry)
    -  BH.oM.Base.[IObject](/api/oM/Framework/Base/Interface/IObject)


## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Elements | [List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.List-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[IGeometry](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Interface/IGeometry)&gt; | A list of assorted geometry, which together define the composite shape. | - |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |

| IBounds | [BoundingBox](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Misc/BoundingBox) | Returns the global world axis oriented enclosing BoundingBox for all points of the geometry, i.e. the box with the smallest volume within which all the points on the geometry lie. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IHashArray | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0)[] | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for distance-based comparisons and diffing.<br>The hash is computed as an array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimize collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IIsPlanar | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if the IGeometry is planar, i.e. all of its parts fit in a single plane. | - | Geometry_Engine |

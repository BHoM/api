| Z | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Dimension along global Z coordinate axis. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |

| GeometryHash | [string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.String?view=netstandard-2.0) | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for diffing.<br>The hash is computed as a serialised array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimize collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IArea | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the area of the provided geometry. | [Area](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Area) [mÂ²] | Geometry_Engine |
| IBounds | [BoundingBox](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Misc/BoundingBox) | Returns the global world axis oriented enclosing BoundingBox for all points of the geometry, i.e. the box with the smallest volume within which all the points on the geometry lie. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IHashArray | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0)[] | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for distance-based comparisons and diffing.<br>The hash is computed as an array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimize collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |

| IIsValid | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | - | - | Geometry_Engine |
| INormals | [List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.List-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[Vector](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector/Vector)&gt; | Interface method that returns the list of vectors normal to any IGeometry. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IsNull | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if a Geometry is null and outputs relevant error message. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IsOrthogonal | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Queries whether a vector is orthogonal in relation to global X, Y or Z axis. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IsPlanar | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if the Vector is planar, i.e. all of its parts fit in a single plane. For a Vector this is always the case, why this method always returns true. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| ISubParts | [IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[IGeometry](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Interface/IGeometry)&gt; | - | - | Geometry_Engine |

| LargestComponent | [Vector](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector/Vector) | Returns the largest component as determined by one vector, dependent upon which axis is more represented vector. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| Length | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the length of a Vector. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] | Geometry_Engine |
| SquareLength | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the square length of a Vector. Faster to compute than the length and can be usefull for example where only relative lengths between vectors are sought. | - | Geometry_Engine |

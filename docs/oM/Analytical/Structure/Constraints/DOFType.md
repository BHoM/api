# Structure.Constraints.DOFType

Enumerator outlining the fixity of a particular degree of freedom. Controls if the DOF should be free, fixed or stiffness based.

## Enum values

| Name            | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Free |  Free to translate or rotate, depending on the DOF.  |
| Fixed |  Fixed in translation or rotation, depending on the DOF.  |
| FixedNegative |  Zero stiffness in the positive direction.  |
| FixedPositive |  Zero stiffness in the negative direction.  |
| Spring |  Linear spring constant.  |
| SpringNegative |  Nonlinear, zero stiffness in the positive direction.  |
| SpringPositive |  Nonlinear, zero stiffness in the negative direction.  |
| SpringRelative |  Spring stiffness between 0-1 relates to the element to which the DOF applies (e.g. bar end stiffness).  |
| SpringRelativeNegative |  Nonlinear, Spring stiffness between 0-1 relates to the element to which the DOF applies (e.g. bar end stiffness), zero stiffness in the positive direction.  |
| SpringRelativePositive |  Nonlinear, Spring stiffness between 0-1 relates to the element to which the DOF applies (e.g. bar end stiffness), zero stiffness in the negative direction.  |
| NonLinear |  Nonlinear spring model.  |
| Friction |  Friction model (relative to the load applied).  |
| Damped |  Damped velocities/accelerations.  |
| Gap |  Gap model.  |


## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

The enum is defined in C#. The class definition is available on github:

- [DOFType.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Structure_oM/Constraints/Enums/DOFType.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.

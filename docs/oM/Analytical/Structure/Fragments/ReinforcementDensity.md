## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Density | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | The mass of reinforcement per unit volume of the element that owns this fragment. | [Density](/api_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Density) [kg/mÂ³] |
| Material | [IMaterialFragment](/api_documentation/oM/Analytical/Structure/MaterialFragments/IMaterialFragment) | Homogeneous material of the reinforcement. | - |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         | Engine           |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| IsNull | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if a ReinforcementDensity is null and outputs relevant error message. | - | Structure_Engine |

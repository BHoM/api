## Enum values

| Name            | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| EigenvectorComponent |  Results normalised so that the absolute value of the maximum component of the mode shape for the mode and case is equal to 1.  |
| EigenvectorTotal |  Results normalised so that the square root sum of squares for the displacement of the mode and case is equal to 1.  |
| MassComponent |  Results normalised so that the absolute value of the maximum component of the mass for the mode and case is equal to 1.  |
| MassTotal |  Results normalised so that the square root sum of squares for mass of the mode and case is equal to 1.  |

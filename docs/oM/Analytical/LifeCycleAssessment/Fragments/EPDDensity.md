# LifeCycleAssessment.Fragments.EPDDensity

A data fragment used to store Density values if provided from the EPD source. 
Density is a required property for all Evaluations of EPDs with Mass-QuantityType.Density can be changed by the user by adding this fragment to an EPD. 
The user accepts responsibility for any changes beyond the given dataset information as not all EPDs will contain Density values.
